**Efficiency Analysis**

We compare the performance of this work to that of the state of the art, both for non-universal SNARKs and universal SNARKs.

At the time of publication, the only fully succinct universal SNARK construction is MBKM19. This protocol requires the prover to compute 273n G1 group exponentiations, where n is the number of multiplication gates. In fully-succinct Sonic, every wire can be used in three linear relationships, requiring the addition of 'dummy' multiplications to accommodate wires used in more than three additional gates.

This increase in the multiplicative gate count is factored into the prover computation estimate (see MBKM19 for full details).

Our universal SNARK requires the prover to compute 5 polynomial commitments, combined with two opening proofs to evaluate the polynomial commitments at a random challenge point. There are two "flavors" of PlonK: the total proof size can be reduced by approximately 10%. The combined degree of the polynomials is either 9(n+a) (larger proofs), or 11(n+a) (smaller proofs, reduced verifier work).

Currently, the most efficient fully-succinct SNARK construction available is Groth16. This construction requires a unique, non-updatable CRS per circuit and has proof construction times dominated by 3n+m G1 and nG2 group exponentiations, where m is the number of R1CS variables.

If we assume that one G2 exponentiation is equivalent to three G1 exponentiations, then this construction yields 6n+3m G1 group exponentiations. This is approximately 1.1 times more prover work than Sonic, and about 30 times fewer prover computations than the universal SNARK.

When evaluating common circuits, we find that the number of addition gates is twice the number of multiplication gates. However, circuits optimized for PlonK have fewer gates under this assumption.

At one extreme, for a circuit with no addition gates and only fan-in-2 multiplications, our universal SNARK requires approximately 1.1 times more prover work than Sonic, while Groth16 requires about 30 times fewer computations.

When comparing proof constructions, we also include the number of field multiplications required to construct proofs in PlonK. All other succinct universal SNARK constructions have high FFTs.
