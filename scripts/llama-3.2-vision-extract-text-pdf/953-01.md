Abstract
------

zk-SNARK constructions that utilize an updatable universal structured reference string remove one of the main obstacles in deploying zk-SNARKs. The important work of Maller et al. MBKM19 presented Sonic - the first potentially practical zk-SNARK with full succinct verification for general arithmetic circuits with an SRS. However, the version of Sonic enabling full succinct verification still requires relatively high proof construction overheads. We present a universal SNARK construction with full succinct verification and significantly lower prover running time (roughly 7.5-20 times fewer group exponentiations than MBKM19 in the fully succinct verifier mode depending on circuit structure). Similarly to MBKM19, we rely on a permutation argument based on Bayer and Groth BG12. However, we focus on "Evaluations on a subgroup rather than coefficients of monomials", which simplifies both the permutation argument and the arithmetization step.

Introduction
------------

Due to real-world deployments of zk-SNARKs, it has become of significant interest to have structured reference strings (SRS) that are constructible in a "universal" and updatable fashion. Meaning that the same SRS can be used for statements about all circuits of bounded size; and that at any point in time the SRS can be updated by a new party, such that the honesty of only one party from all updaters is required for soundness. For brevity, let us call a zk-SNARK with such a setup process "universal". For the purpose of this introduction, let us say a zk-SNARK for circuit satisfiability is fully succinct if.
